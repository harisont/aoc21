# Advent of Code 2021

## Things learned
Here is a nonexhaustive list of the things I had to look up and learn:

- [`Any`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-any/), the Kotlin counterpart of Java `Object`s
- how to [generalize `transpose`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70230712/generic-transpose-or-anything-else-really-in-kotlin/70230823#70230823) (or anything else that has something to do with arrays really)
- how mutable lists work
- Kotlin's ternary operator
- [import weirdnesses](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48796929/kotlin-cannot-import-packages)
